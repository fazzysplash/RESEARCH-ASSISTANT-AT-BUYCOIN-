Using recursion method to find Fibonacci of a number is a bad idea, because it use more memory and time. Now when we call function it uses some memory let say function had variable a&b, it will use some memory to store those variable. now when we recall the function (recursion) then compiler will allocate another memory for the same variable a&b (it will make copy of a&b) making it take more memory space. Recursion is slow because it uses stack method. This is not a good option for finding Fibonacci.
